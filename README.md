# Hybrid-Images

To run this, you first have to get two images that you want to hybridize in .png form and put these two images in the images folder in the project.

Then you call:

python hybrid_image_starter.py [first_image] [second_image]

(For example, say you have two images called a.png and b.png

To run it, you type in:
python hybrid_image_starter.py a b )

Then a small window should output and you need to select two points per image. The points basically dictate the alignment.

After you've selected two points per image, the final hybridized image should pop up in a new window.
